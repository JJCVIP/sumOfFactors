## README
Some quick dirty code to find numbers (n) whose factors (outside of 1 and n) add up to itself. An example is 4 with factors 2 and 2. something that would not count is 16 which is broken down into 2+4+4+8 = 18.

**Note:** This looks at all factors not only the prime factorization!

The only number found so far is 4. Wether 4 is the only possible number is an open problem.
